# React
my first React project is a basic Calculator.
I have used useReducer function which includes all actions 
such as 
1.add digits(means adding for an Operand)2.
2.choosing operation
3.clear the current calculation
4.deleting the last digit given in current operand
5.finally evaluating the previousOpearand and currentOperand.
these actions are done by switch case.
Another switch case used for selecting the operation in the 'evaluate' function for evaluation(computation) of operands.
the numbers whcich are returns as strings specified as "en-us" number format by using Intl.NumberFormat() function or method.
CSS used for styling the Calculator.
you can see the Calculator--->
